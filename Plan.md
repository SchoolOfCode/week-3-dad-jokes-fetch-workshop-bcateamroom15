We've accessed the dadjokes API using Postman and received a lot of data in a html file

We want to replace the list of jokes with a random joke from the API

So we need to access the API in Javascript and access the specific property which gives us a random joke back

What is that property? Inspect the data

Replace the jokes with a new Async function

We have accessed a random joke in the console
the propert joke has the text we want
